       I have been hurting you a lot lately... <br>
       I really feel like unworthy, I love you so much I never want to hurt you
       but look what I am doing... 
       I made you cry today.. I.. I didnt want that.. 
       I promised you you'd only cry from happiness if you are with me... 
       I said you will feel only love not the pain..
       But I couldnt keep my promise... You cried because of me... 
       I won't forgive myself...

        I really was dying emotionally, I have waited for someone who at least tries to save me
        But none came... None but you.. 
        Only you saw my feelings, only you felt them
        You saw me in pitch black and lent me your hand.  Only you could look at my eyes and feel the pain..
        You didnt just see it, you tried to heal me.. 
        I didnt have someone like you, someone who actually cares about me. 
        Someone who actually feel the lines I wrote.. Feel the emotions I had...
